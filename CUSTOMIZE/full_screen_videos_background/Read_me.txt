Here you can put your 16/9 Full Screen Videos.

First in theme configuration/theme style, select "CUSTOM FULL SCREEN VIDEOS".


You can display a full screen video background for systemview, gamelist view, both or separatly.



	-Put a file named "full.mp4", this will display your loop video in full screen behind the cabinet in system view and gamelist view for all systems.


	-Put a file named "system.mp4", this will display your loop video in full screen behind the cabinet in systemview for all systems.


	-Put a file named "gamelist.mp4", this will display your loop video in full screen behind the cabinet in gamelist view for all systems.


	-Put ".mp4" files named by theme preceded by "both-", "system-" or "gamelist-" ( examples: "full-megadrive.mp4", "system-snes.mp4" or "gamelist-nes" etc..),
	this will display video for each system separately for both views ("both-"), systemview ("system-") or gamelist view ("gamelist-").




For example if you put in same time these 4 files:

	1)-"full.mp4" 			(All systems and views)
	2)-"both-megadrive.mp4"		(All views for Megadrive)
	3)-"system-snes.mp4"		(System view for Super Nintendo) 
	4)-"gamelist-gamegear.mp4"	(Gamelist view for Game Gear)

	this will display:

	- Video (1) in all views and all systems except megadrive for both views, except super nintendo in systemview, except Game Gear in gamelist view.
	- Video (2) in all views for Megadrive.
	- Video (3) in system view for Super Nintendo.
	- Video (4) in gamelist view for Game Gear.

Test by yourself..


If you put at same time "full.mp4", "system.mp4" and "gamelist.mp4", but "full.mp4" will be overwrited by the others.

Idem for specifics systems videos with "both-megadrive", "system-megadrive"" and "gamelist-megadrive".
