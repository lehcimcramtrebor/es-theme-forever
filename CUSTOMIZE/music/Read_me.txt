2 ways for customize your music:



- Mode jukebox:


	To play random musics, place here yours ".mp3" or ".ogg" files.




- Mode by System:


	To play a different music for each system, place here music files named by theme name:

	"megadrive.ogg" or "megadrive.mp3" or "snes.ogg" or "snes.mp3" etc..






	Now select " Custom Sounds " in theme configuration.




	Don't forget to adjust song parameters in emulationstation menu.

	I have put Batocera Musics in this folder for Retrobat Users, you can delete them.
