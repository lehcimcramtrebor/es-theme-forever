2 ways for customize your music:



- Mode jukebox:


	To play random musics, place here yours ".mp3" or ".ogg" files in jukebox folder.
	Select "Custom jukebox" in theme configuration menu.
	Don't forget to uncheck "Display songs title" in emulationstation audio settings.




- Mode by System:


	To play a different music for each system, place here music files named by theme name:

	"megadrive.ogg" or "megadrive.mp3" or "snes.ogg" or "snes.mp3" etc..

	Select "Custom By system" in theme configuration menu.
	Don't forget to check "Display songs title" in emulationstation audio settings.


	Don't forget to adjust song parameters in emulationstation menu.

	I have put Batocera Musics in "jukebox" folder for Retrobat Users, you can delete them.
